# Project Euler Solutions (Problems 1–100)

Welcome to my solutions repository for Project Euler challenges, focusing on problems 1 through 100. All solutions are implemented in Python.

> **Note:** Solutions for problems beyond #100 are not included here due to Project Euler's terms of use.

## About Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require creative problem-solving and programming skills.

## Repository Structure

- Each problem (1–100) is solved in a dedicated Python file.
- The code is organized for clarity and learning purposes, with comments explaining key steps.
- Any required utility scripts or shared functions are included in the repo.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yehuda-Levy923/Project_Euler.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Project_Euler
   ```
3. **Run a solution:**
   ```bash
   python problem_1.py
   ```
   Replace `problem_1.py` with the desired problem file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

No external dependencies are required for most problems unless otherwise stated in the problem file.

## Contribution

This repository is for personal learning and demonstration purposes. If you have suggestions or spot an issue, feel free to open an issue or pull request.


**Disclaimer:** Solutions from problem 101 onwards are private and will not be shared here, in accordance with Project Euler’s terms and conditions.
