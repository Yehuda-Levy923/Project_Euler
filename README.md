# [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) – Python Solutions (Problems 1–100)

Welcome to this repository containing my Python solutions to the first 100 problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

This collection was created as part of my ongoing effort to improve my problem-solving and programming skills. I’m sharing these solutions to support others working through the same challenges and to encourage discussion and learning within the community.

> **Note:**  
> In keeping with Project Euler’s policy, solutions are provided only for the first 100 problems to respect the integrity of newer challenges.

## Repository Structure

- Each problem is stored in a separate `.py` file (e.g., `Problem1.py`, `Problem2.py`, etc.).
- Solutions are written in standard Python, with no third-party libraries.
- Comments are included in the code to clarify the approach and logic behind each solution.

## Purpose

This project serves as:

- A personal learning archive  
- A reference for others working through similar problems  
- A demonstration of clean, readable Python code applied to mathematical and algorithmic challenges

Thank you for visiting, and best of luck with your own Project Euler journey!
